    "\n",
    "Co-founder and Chief creative Officer, Sršen springboarded the company by utilizing her art background to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world to be more proactive about their health and habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "As at 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[Bellabeat app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bellabeat.cacao&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1)** an app monitors health data and menstrual cycles by syncing with other Bellabeat smart products.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[Leaf](https://bellabeat.com/shop/)** a wellness tracker that can be worn as a bracelet, necklace or clip and is used to track sleep and stress. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **[Time](https://bellabeat.com/shop/)** a watch device that connects to the Bellabeat app and tracks activity, sleep and stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[Spring](https://bellabeat.com/shop/)** a water bottle that connects to the Bellabeat app and tracks daily water intake to make sure that customers stay hydrated during the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, Youtube ads, maintaining active [Facebook](https://web.facebook.com/bellabeat/?_rdc=1&_rdr) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bellabeat/?hl=en) pages, and consistently engages consumers on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GetBellaBeat) in order to stay updated on current marketing trends. \n",

    "\n",
    "However, Urška Sršen believes that Bellabeat can be doing more to extend their growth and she believes that the best way to do this is by analyzing customer from similar products (i.e. Fitbit). "

    "**Interpreting these findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:** The average total steps accumulated on the fitbit app was 7638. A study published in **[The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2468-2667%2821%2900302-9)** stated that individuals who walked an average of 6000 to 10,000 steps were less likely to face health issues, regardless of gender or age. In fact, their health issues were cut by half. However, it is difficult  to judge what steps were taken by only women since gender was not part of the stats collected by the surveyors. According to this study, age plays a bigger role than gender when it comes to steps. The threshold for >60 year olds was 3000 steps while for <60 year olds was 5000 steps. However, the data does not account for age so there is no way of knowing how an elderly demographic might interact with Bellabeat [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calories burnt:** According to our data, the average calories burnt was 2304, while 4900 was the maximum amount of calories. According to a **[Health Line article](https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/how-many-calories-do-i-burn-a-day#_noHeaderPrefixedContent)** by Katey Davidson, women need burn about 1980 calories a day so the participants in the survey were definitely exceeding their goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outliers:** There were several outliers which showed that an individual consistently had over 20,000 steps a day which could either be due to a recording error, a very athletic individual or some with a demanding job according to a **[Health Line article](https://www.healthline.com/health/average-steps-per-day#occupation\n",
