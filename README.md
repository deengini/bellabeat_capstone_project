# **Project Bellabeat: How can a Wellness Technology Company Play it Smart?**

## **Project Description**

This project is based on from the Google Data Analytics Capstone Project on Cousera. The goal of this portfolio project was to use R programming to analyze FitBit tracking data from 30 individuals to inform the marketing decisions of Bellabeat, another fitness tracking company. 

R programming was used to analyze the data because of the seamlessness and ease in cleaning, manipulating and visualizing the data. 

## **Table of Contents**

This repository contains the following: 

* A [Juypter notebook](https://github.com/deengini/bellabeat_capstone_project/blob/main/bellabeat_case_study.ipynb) report of the entire project.

* An [R document](https://github.com/deengini/bellabeat_capstone_project/blob/main/project_cleaning.R) of the entire cleaning process.

* An [R document](https://github.com/deengini/bellabeat_capstone_project/blob/main/project_visualization.R) of the entire visualization process.

## **Challenges**

Some of the challenges I faced while completing this project are as follows: 

* The sample size of the data was not representative enough so it is important that more credible data sources be identified so our insights are more conclusive. 

* The parameters of the data were not comprehensive enough. Bellabeat is a female focused company and there were no gender or age parameters, so it was difficult to really draw specific conclusions. 

* It was difficult trying to install R on a Jupyter notebook but this was solved by the help of this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydScgWT6yOU&list=PLfL_Rchl4f3RxKo0vNmmQFbLmx1068ucN&index=2&ab_channel=DaleNakasone)
